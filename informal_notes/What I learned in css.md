so in my words 90 viewport height takes up 90% of the viewable screen.

also to create a border i would just type border then a certian px to show how thick or thin i ant the line 
(smaller is thinner, bigger is thicker)

To make the contents or "elements" of a container or class move horizontally on the page with less coding 
flex can help with that.

by default the flex-direction is set to row which make my content appear horizontally across 
the page.

so row-reverse keeps the horizontal look but changes the order. So if i had numbers as 1, 2, 3, 4
it now literally reverses the order to 4, 3, 2, 1.

to arrange these element to go up and down vertically we can use a FLEX-DIRECTION as column. One
will be at the top and 4 will be the bottom. Column reverse will just reverse the order of the numbers so opposite.
the 4 will be that the top and one will be at the bottom. 

next we have justify content property. it sets the alignment on the MAIN-AXIS. Think of the MAIN-AXIS as a 
refference to math. The MAIN-AXIS beig the X-AXIS according to planes and graph.

by deafult it will be 1-4 horizontally which will justify or align the numbers on the left which is 
default or known as FLEX-START. 
]
FLEX-END will justify all of the content at the END or right justified.

by justifying the content in the center it will literally just center whaevter content i have in the literal center of the 
page. Pretty easy to remember hopefully.

by JUSTIFYING the CONTENT with the SPACE-BETWEEN value it will increase the space between the 
numbers 1  2  3  4 instead of 1234. And when i expand the page it will the keep the numbers spaced.

the SPACE-AROUND value includes the area outside of the element.

the container is all the content within that is being mainpulated. The BORDER usually outlines the container and shows both the 
margin and padding. Visually it helps to show that for me.

When selecting an id you use the hashtags symbol '#'. When reffering to a class use a period '.'
