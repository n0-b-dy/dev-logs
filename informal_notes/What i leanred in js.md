Just going to jot down a couple things ive learned from the javascript tutorial from beau carnes
on the codecamp website on youtube. 



1. When adding two numbers together for example a = a + 12 you can use the plus eqauls operator 
as a shortcut for all the mathamatical operations.

An example would be instead of a = a + 12

plus equals opertaor:

a += 12. PRETTY NEAT AYE

and this can be apllied for ALL OF THE OPERATORS!!

2. Escaping literal quotes in strings
