# DEVELOPER LOG

## Dev Logs

#### 02-07-2024.

-This is going to be sort of a more informal log of what new things I have learned so far with either videos, websites, or podcasts. It will basically at as a catch-all for all new things until I get more comfortable with using the markdown syntax because it does take awhile for all the notes to look pretty. But I know it will be worth it.
