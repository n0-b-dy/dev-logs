# DEVELOPER LOG

## Dev Logs

#### 02-07-2024.

-This is going to be sort of a more informal log of what new things I have learned so far with either videos, websites, or podcasts. It will basically act as a catch-all for all new things until I get more comfortable with using the markdown syntax because it does take awhile for all the notes to look pretty. But I know it will be worth it.

-I  have been learning alot on this journey, while still being confused with CSS and some doubt but persistence is key and I am farther now than I was a couple months ago. So I am progressing. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

-I have been consistenly progressing in my code and while still frustrated with the slow pace sometimes I can say I am frequently thinking about finishing my projects, thinking about code, and wanting to finally make a project on my own. They did say it's a journey, not a race, afterall. Well, I should be able to get my project up and running tonight on netlify, so better get to it then.
