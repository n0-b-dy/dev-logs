# DEVELOPER LOG

## Dev Logs

#### 02-07-2024.

-This is going to be sort of a more informal log of what new things I have learned so far with either videos, websites, or podcasts. It will basically act as a catch-all for all new things until I get more comfortable with using the markdown syntax because it does take awhile for all the notes to look pretty. But I know it will be worth it.

-I  have been learning alot on this journey, while still being confused with CSS and some doubt but persistence is key and I am farther now than I was a couple months ago. So I am progressing. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

-I have been consistenly progressing in my code and while still frustrated with the slow pace sometimes I can say I am frequently thinking about finishing my projects, thinking about code, and wanting to finally make a project on my own. They did say it's a journey, not a race, afterall. Well, I should be able to get my project up and running tonight on netlify, so better get to it then.

- Another thing I want to add is that I was talking to another dude on Discord today and it made me realize that I have been learning alot. I am a frequent watcher of a YouTuber and when I first watched his videos and folwing along I was clueless on what he was talking about. It was like that meme where that dude hypnotized this guy and said he's a martian and speaking in a high-pitched voice saying gibberish-funniest thing ever. So, I started gradually learning concepts more and more. Watching videos going to w3schools and reddit and now a couple of months (about 3) I can say that I can actually undertand everything or almost. I would say about 90-95% of everything he discussed. I'm excited for the future and this is what drives part of my frustration. I want to move too fast sometimes. But it is just a journey, not a marathon. I only got like 3 months to go.
