# DEVELOPER LOG

## Dev Logs

#### 02-07-2024.

-This is going to be sort of a more informal log of what new things I have learned so far with either videos, websites, or podcasts. It will basically act as a catch-all for all new things until I get more comfortable with using the markdown syntax because it does take awhile for all the notes to look pretty. But I know it will be worth it.

#### 04-10-2024.

-I  have been learning alot on this journey, while still being confused with CSS and some doubt but persistence is key and I am farther now than I was a couple months ago. So I am progressing. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

#### 04-11-2024.

-I have been consistenly progressing in my code and while still frustrated with the slow pace sometimes I can say I am frequently thinking about finishing my projects, thinking about code, and wanting to finally make a project on my own. They did say it's a journey, not a race, afterall. Well, I should be able to get my project up and running tonight on netlify, so better get to it then.

- Another thing I want to add is that I was talking to another dude on Discord today and it made me realize that I have been learning alot. I am a frequent watcher of a YouTuber and when I first watched his videos and folwing along I was clueless on what he was talking about. It was like that meme where that dude hypnotized this guy and said he's a martian and speaking in a high-pitched voice saying gibberish-funniest thing ever. So, I started gradually learning concepts more and more. Watching videos going to w3schools and reddit and now a couple of months (about 3) I can say that I can actually undertand everything or almost. I would say about 90-95% of everything he discussed. I'm excited for the future and this is what drives part of my frustration. I want to move too fast sometimes. But it is just a journey, not a marathon. I only got like 3 months to go. 

#### 04-12-2024.

-Alrighty, where to begin. Firstly, I am feeling overwhelmed when watching YouTube tutorials but i know thats all apart of the game and I need to overcome it somehow. I woke up feeling like it is all so much to remember but then when I am in the project looking at the code it does become familiar again. This feeling is strange.. Some things I think I should brush up on are some terms I am not familiar with and will study those tonight. You know what really helped me was looking at what one term means at a time on youtube. Like a visual guide that some videos provide. I did not understand margin and padding but when I looked up a video it really helped visually. After, I should really jump into Javascript in the next couple of days.


#### 04-14-2024.

- Today I've been learning about JavaScript. I've learned pretty much the basics like variables, functions, arrays and much more. The problem with my current roadmap is that It just shows me the basics and not a lot of how to apply them in a project but there are other sources like w3 and bro code so I think I may go with those for further help.

#### 04-15-2024.

- I may have deviated from the roadmap a little. I seen a  tiktok video about using openai api key that interacts with a projector and other iot devices to create an ironman 'holomat' as it is dubbed by its creator. Unfortunately, it is locked behind a paywall. But it is used with python code, so cant be that hard, right? 

- Anyway, I will get back onto my javascript code and will finish the video and be looking on FCC and w3 for further explanations on topics I do not uncerstand.

#### 04-16-2024.

- Today I leanred basic javascript syntax and concepts by watching the smoljames intro video. 
    - Intro to js and how it works
    - Js fundamentals like syntax, including variables, data types, and operators.
    - Control flow through conditional statements and loops.
    - Basic functions and their use in structuring code.

- Quick side tangent, I dont really feel like I know this though as good as it may sound. So, I will be trying Bro code's video and some w3 to try and understanding through more practical examples and methods. I know it is oonly a video on the introdcution but I have always been not able to understand loops since in college with c++ but I will try harder.
